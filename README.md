# PistonPanel

*ðŸŒ  Next-gen game-server hosting panel*

## About

> [!NOTE]  
> PistonPanel is currently in development, but you cannot use this project yet. Many features are missing, so you'll have to wait a bit until everything is ready. Check back to see if anything has changed.

PistonPanel is a web-based game server management panel that allows you to manage your game servers from anywhere.
It is designed to be easy to use and provides a modern interface for managing your game servers.

Unique features of PistonPanel:
- Organisations - Manage multiple servers in one place. Invite members to your organisation to collaborate.
- Kubernetes - While other panels rely on Docker, PistonPanel is built with only Kubernetes support, providing multi-node features like no other panel can.
- Auth - With a highly advanced authentication system, support login methods like Passkeys, 2FA, email codes, magic links, Google, Microsoft, Apple... and more!
- Fully customnizable - If you know React and Typescript, you can modify the panel code to your liking.

## Installation
