# PistonPanel

**ðŸŒ  Next-gen game-server hosting panel**

## About

> [!NOTE]
> PistonPanel is currently in early development; you cannot use this project yet. Many features are missing, so you'll
> have to wait a bit until everything is ready. Check back to see if anything has changed.

PistonPanel is a web-based game server management panel that allows you to manage your game servers from anywhere.
It is designed to be easy to use and provides a modern interface for managing your game servers.

Unique features of PistonPanel:

- Organisations: Manage multiple servers in one place. Invite members to your organisation to collaborate.
- Kubernetes: While other panels rely on Docker, PistonPanel is built with only Kubernetes support, providing multi-node
  features like no other panel can.
- Auth: With a highly advanced authentication system, support login methods like Passkeys, 2FA, email codes, magic
  links, Google, Microsoft, Apple... and more!
- Fully customizable: If you know React and TypeScript, you can modify the panel code to your liking.

## Building

PistonPanel has a lot of dependencies. You'll need pnpm and the latest node installed.
Take a look at the scripts in `package.json` to see how to run a dev env locally.
You can also refer to the GitHub actions workflows to see how tests are done.
